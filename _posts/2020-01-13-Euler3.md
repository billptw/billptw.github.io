title: Euler#3 Largest prime factor
---

Continuing the [Project Euler Challenge](https://projecteuler.net/), we look at prime numbers this time round.

## Problem
High level idea: Find the largest prime factor of a given $$N$$.

Input: $$T+1$$ lines of integers. As always, the first line contains $$T$$ that denotes the number of test cases. This is followed by $$T$$ lines, each containing an integer, $$N$$.

Constraints:

$$1 \leq T \leq 10^5$$

$$10 \leq N \leq 10^12$$

Note that the value of N begins from 10.

## First thoughts
One way to tackle the problem is to factorise a given number into its primes and return its largest factor. Prime factorisation is one of the first few lessons taught in secondary school math... it's interesting to get to solve it programmatically now!

A [prime number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) is a natural number greater than $$1$$ that is only divisible by itself and $$1$$. Based on that definition, we can shorten the search space for checking if a number $$n$$ is a prime by checking for divisibility $$\leq \sqrt{n}$$. Here's why:

If the number $$n$$ is not a prime, it can be expressed into at least two numbers $$a$$ and $$b$$. $$a \geq \sqrt{n} \implies b < \sqrt{n}$$, so finding $$b$$ in that case would suffice to show it is not a prime.

Furthermore, we only need to check for divisibility with primes, as divisibility with composite numbers should then be further decomposed into primes.

```python
    print(ans)
```
