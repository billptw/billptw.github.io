To prevent procrastination arising from a mixture of perfectionism and a healthy dose of laziness, I shall start the blogging adventure with a historic model, the encoder-decoder architecture in sequence-to-sequence modeling [(Sutskever et al., 2014)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.3215.pdf), and explain the motivations behind its creation.
