title: Euler#2 Even Fibonacci numbers
---

Continuing the [Project Euler Challenge](https://projecteuler.net/), we look at the definitive recursion problem in computer science: dealing with the Fibonacci sequence by summing over even numbers in the sequence for the [second example](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler002/problem):

## Problem
High level idea: Find the sum of all the even numbers of the Fibonacci sequence below $$N$$.

Input: $$T+1$$ lines of integers. First line contains $$T$$ that denotes the number of test cases. This is followed by $$T$$ lines, each containing an integer, $$N$$. (Note: This is similar to [the previous problem]({% post_url 2020-01-09-Euler1 %}). I have a feeling this is going to be the Hackerrank default template).

Constraints:

$$1 \leq T \leq 10^5$$

$$10 \leq N \leq 4 \times 10^6$$

Note that the value of N begins from 10.

## First thoughts
Let's define the vanilla [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number):

$$F_{n} = F{n-1} + F{n-2}$$

This means that for each number of the sequence, it is obtained by adding the previous two numbers before it. Here is the first $$10$$ numbers in the sequence:

$$(0),1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,\ldots$$

For example, to obtain the fourth number in the sequence $$F_{4}, we sum $$2$$ and $$3$$ to obtain $$5$$.

Here is the code implementation of the Fibonnaci sequence in Python:

```python
# naive fibonnaci
def fib(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
