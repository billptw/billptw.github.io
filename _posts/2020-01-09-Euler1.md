title: Euler#1: Multiples of 3 and 5
---

As another year begins, I decided to pick up the [Project Euler Challenge](https://projecteuler.net/). This daily training in computational thinking and debugging will hopefully serve well as 'mental gymming'. Without further ado, let's begin with the [first example](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler001/problem):

Input: First line contains  that denotes the number of test cases. This is followed by $T$ lines, each containing an integer, $N$.


```python
def get_sum(n):
    n = n-1
    sum3 = 0 if n < 3 else int((n - (n%3))/3)
    sum5 = 0 if n < 5 else int((n- (n%5))/5)
    sum15 = 0 if n < 15 else int((n- (n%15))/15)
    return (sum5*(10+(sum5-1)*5) + sum3*(6+(sum3-1)*3) - sum15*(30+(sum15-1)*15)>>1)

t = int(input().strip())

for a0 in range(t):
    n = int(input().strip())
    print(get_sum(n))

```
