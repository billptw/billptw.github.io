title: Euler#5 Smallest multiple
---

## Problem
High level idea: Find the smallest multiple that is divisible by all integers $$\leq N$$.

Input: $$T+1$$ lines of integers. As always, the first line contains $$T$$ that denotes the number of test cases. This is followed by $$T$$ lines, each containing an integer, $$N$$.

Constraints:

$$1 \leq T \leq 10$$

$$1 \leq N \leq 40$$


## First thoughts
This problem requires us to find the lowest common multiple of all numbers up to $$N$$.

We can iteratively build the list of multiples by multipliying all integers from $$1$$ to $$N$$, . Intuitively, for every composite number $$\mathbb{C} \in \{1, N \}$$, there exists prime numbers smaller than the composite number which are factors of the composite.

```python
def is_palindrome(n):
    number = str(n)
    i = 0
    while i <= len(number)/2-1:
        if number[i] != number[-1-i]:
            return False
        i += 1
    return True
```
