title: Euler#8 Largest product in a series

High level idea: Find the greatest product of $$K$$ consecutive digits in the $$N$$ digit number.

Input: $$T+1$$ lines of integers. As always, the first line contains $$T$$ that denotes the number of test cases. Each test case comprises containing integers $$K$$ and $$N$$, as well as the $$N$$ digit long integer itself.

Constraints:

$$1 \leq T \leq 100$$

$$1 \leq K \leq 7$$

$$K \leq N \leq 1000$$


## Solution
To break down the problem statement: We are supposed to parse the input number of $$N$$ digits and generate all combinations of $$K$$ digit consecutive numbers (basically $$N - K + 1$$ combinations). The solution is straight-forward in coding, noting that we have to handle the assignment of the first digit in each combination (lest everything becomes multiplied by the instantiated value of the placeholder variable).

```python
def get_num(n,k,num):
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n-k+1):
        val = 0
        for j in range(k):
            val = int(num[i+j]) if j == 0 else val * int(num[i+j])
        if val > ans:
            ans = val
    return ans
```

This solution employs no math tricks, and instead is a string/array splicing coding practice. To better improve the robustness of this solution, one can employ checks to ensure each typecasting character in the input string is indeed a number (by filtering out for values $$> 10$$). We leave that for future work, as the problem statement states that the input will be a number.
