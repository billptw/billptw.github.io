High level idea: Find the $$N^{th}$$ prime number.

Input: $$T+1$$ lines of integers. As always, the first line contains $$T$$ that denotes the number of test cases. This is followed by $$T$$ lines, each containing an integer, $$N$$.

Constraints:

$$1 \leq T \leq 10^3$$

$$1 \leq N \leq 10^4$$


## Solution
This problem requires us to efficiently compute prime numbers. Generating a list of primes was covered in [the third Euler problem]({% post_url 2020-01-13-Euler3 %}), and primarily consists of a helper method *is_prime* that checks if a given number is a prime number (remember that we up to $$\sqrt{n}$$, check out the previous post for more details), and another, *get_primes*, that builds up the list up to a required $$N$$.

```python
def is_prime(n, primes):
    sqrt_n = int(math.sqrt(n))
    for prime in primes:
        if n % prime == 0:
            return False
        if prime >= sqrt_n:
            return True
    return True
                
                    
# instantiating list of primes
primes = [2, 3]

# build list of primes
def get_primes(n, primes):
    last = primes[-1]
    while n > len(primes):
        last += 2
        if is_prime(last, primes):
            primes.append(last)
```

The key thing to note is this method allows us to save a list of primes and continue off where we have last computed up to, saving us lots of time.
